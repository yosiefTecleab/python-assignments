in the range(n) function in better_addition the problem reside there.

-for n in range(num_rechecks): num_rechecks must be non zero. it must be greater than or equal to one.
the first input test (4, 7, 0, 11) the 0 will pass to num_rechecks when the function better_addition is called.
which is fail when sum_computations to be assigned. that is range(0) which is empty.

so test case (4, 7, 0, 11) is failed.
